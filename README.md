# Cross-Chain Token Transfer Using CEX

## What is this?

This is a cross-chain token transfer bridge that utilizes a **Centralized Exchange (CEX)** to allow users to transfer tokens between different blockchains without needing a dedicated bridge. It eliminates concerns about token support or liquidity issues, providing a simple and efficient solution for token transfers across chains.

## Why use this?

### Benefits of using a CEX for cross-chain bridging:

- **Low Transaction Costs**: The use of a CEX allows for cheaper transfer fees compared to traditional decentralized bridges.
- **Multi-chain and High Liquidity**: CEX platforms typically support multiple blockchains with a wide range of tokens and higher liquidity.
- **Security and Control**: By using your own account and self-hosting the bridge, you maintain control and enhance the security of your transfers.

## How to use this?

### Steps to deploy:

1. **Set up the bot and environment:**
   - Clone the repository and install dependencies.
   - Create a `.env` file and add your `BOT_TOKEN`, `BINANCE_API_KEY`, and `BINANCE_API_SECRET`.
   
2. **Deploy the bot:**
   - Use the Vercel CLI to deploy your bot to a server.
   
3. **Start interacting with the bot:**
   - Once deployed, use the Telegram bot to manage cross-chain transfers and request deposit addresses.
   
This solution simplifies cross-chain transfers, ensuring cost-efficiency, security, and control over your token movements.
### Note : Ensure that your server IP is properly configured
